# The Movie DB Java API (work in progess)

Yet another tmdb java api to access [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

However this one is more experimental and unfinished and meant for usage in my personal projects so far. This means not all endpoints are or will be implemented.

It aims at using little dependencies and using native java 11.

If you are looking for more finished APIs have a look at the following java APIs:

* https://github.com/UweTrottmann/tmdb-java
* https://github.com/holgerbrandl/themoviedbapi
* https://github.com/Omertron/api-themoviedb

Also, there is a full and excellent [documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/) on the API.
