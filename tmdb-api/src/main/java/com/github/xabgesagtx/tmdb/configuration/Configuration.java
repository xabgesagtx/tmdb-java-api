     * <p>This method currently holds the data relevant to building image URLs as well as the change key map.</p> 
     * <p>To build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data. The <code>base_url</code>, <code>size</code> and <code>file_path</code>. Simply combine them all and you will have a fully qualified URL. Hereâ€™s an example URL:</p> 
     * <pre><code>https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/8uO0gUM8aNqYLs1OsTBQiXu0fEv.jpg
     * </code></pre> 
     * <p>The configuration method also contains the list of change keys which can be useful if you are building an app that consumes data from the change feed.</p>
